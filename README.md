# Linear Regression Model using Gradient Descent
Designed Linear Regression Model using Gradient Descent. Regressed IRIS plants’ sepal length and petal width from each other. Implemented in Python.
Designed K Nearest Neighbor Classifier. Used IRIS dataset. The value of k was chosen from 1 to 8 which results in a classification accuracy of 93 to 96 percent. Implemented in MATLAB
