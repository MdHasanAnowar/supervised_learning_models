# Linear Regression using Gradient Descent
Regressed IRIS plantsâ€™ sepal length and petal width from each other. Implemented in Python.

# K Nearest Neighbor Classifier. 
The value of k was chosen from 1-8 which results in a classification accuracy of 93 to 96 percent. Used IRIS dataset and implemented in MATLAB

# IRIS flower dataset
The iris data set is widely used as a beginner's dataset for machine learning purposes. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris 
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals.
